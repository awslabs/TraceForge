// A note on terminology: we have competing notions of threads floating around. Here's the
// convention for disambiguating them:
// * A "thread" is a user-level unit of concurrency. User code creates threads, passes data
//   between them, etc.
// * A "future" is another user-level unit of concurrency, corresponding directly to Rust's notion
//   in std::future::Future. A future has a single method `poll` that can be used to resume
//   executing its computation. Both futures and threads are implemented in Task,
//   which wraps a continuation that is resumed when the task is scheduled.
// * A "task" is the Shuttle executor's reflection of a user-level unit of concurrency. Each task
//   has a corresponding continuation, which is the user-level code it runs, as well as a state like
//   "blocked", "runnable", etc. Scheduling algorithms take as input the state of all tasks
//   and decide which task should execute next. A context switch is when one task stops executing
//   and another begins.
// * A "continuation" is a low-level implementation of green threading for concurrency. Each
//   Task contains a corresponding continuation. When the Shuttle executor context switches to a
//   Task, the executor resumes that task's continuation until it yields, which happens when its
//   thread decides it might want to context switch (e.g., because it's blocked on a lock).
