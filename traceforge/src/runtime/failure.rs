//! This module contains the logic for printing and persisting enough failure information when a
//! test panics to allow the failure to be replayed.
//!
//! The core idea is that we install a custom panic hook (`init_panic_hook`) that runs when a thread
//! panics. That hook tries to print information about the failing schedule by calling
//! `persist_failure`.
//!
//! The complexity in this logic comes from a few requirements beyond the simple panic hook:
//! 1. If a panic occurs within `ExecutionState`, the panic hook might not be able to access the
//!    execution state to retrieve the failing schedule, so we need to be careful about accessing it
//!    and try to recover from this problem when the panic is later caught in
//!    `ExecutionState::step`. We try wherever possible to avoid panicing in this state, but if it
//!    does happen we want to get useful output and not crash.
//! 2. In addition to simply printing the failing schedule, we want to include it in the panic
//!    payload wherever possible, so that we can parse it back out in tests (essentially we are
//!    reinventing try/catch, which is usually an anti-pattern in Rust, but here we don't have
//!    control over the user code that panics). That means sometimes we end up calling
//!    `persist_schedule` twice -- once in the panic hook (where we can't modify the panic payload)
//!    and again when we catch the panic (where we can modify the payload). We don't want to print
//!    the schedule twice, so we keep track of whether the info has already been printed.
